In this course, we will create programs in C++; some will be small and simple while others will be large and complex.  We will introduce basic language features, and talk about principles of software design.  I hope this course provides you with an excellent foundation for your future programming projects.   

In this class we will not watch tv or movies.  It is likely that the instructor will make us watch YouTube for part of class, but that would just be a short break in between topics.
